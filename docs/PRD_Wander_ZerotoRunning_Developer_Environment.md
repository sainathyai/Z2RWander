# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Zero-to-Running Developer Environment is an innovative solution by Wander aimed at revolutionizing how developers set up their local development environments. This product enables new engineers to clone a repository, execute a single command, and instantly have a fully functional multi-service application environment, eliminating manual setup steps. The environment supports a frontend (TS, React, Tailwind), a backend API (Node/Dora, TS), a PostgreSQL database, and a Redis cache. This tool is designed to boost developer productivity by addressing common setup issues and ensuring a seamless, error-free environment configuration process.

## 2. Problem Statement

Developers often face significant delays and frustrations due to complex and inconsistent local environment setups. These challenges lead to non-productive time spent troubleshooting "works on my machine" problems, configuring dependencies, and managing infrastructure. The goal of this product is to enable developers to focus on writing code rather than environment management, thereby increasing productivity and reducing onboarding time.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

- **Goal**: Minimize time spent on environment setup and management.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Reduction in setup time for new developers (target: under 10 minutes).
  - Increase in time spent writing code versus managing infrastructure (target: 80%+ coding time).
  - Reduction in environment-related support tickets (target: 90% decrease).

## 4. Target Users & Personas

- **Target Users**: Software engineers, particularly those newly onboarded to a team, or engineers frequently switching between projects.
- **Personas**:
  - **New Developer**: Alex, a fresh hire, needs to get started quickly without the hassle of manual environment setup.
  - **Ops-Savvy Engineer**: Jamie, an experienced developer with strong ops skills, looks for streamlined processes to maintain focus on coding.

## 5. User Stories

1. As a **new developer**, I want to clone the repository and run a single command to set up my environment so that I can start coding immediately.
2. As an **ops-savvy engineer**, I want to configure my environment using a config file so that I can customize it according to my preferences.
3. As a **developer**, I want to see clear feedback during the setup process so that I know if everything is working correctly.
4. As a **developer**, I want to tear down my environment with a single command to maintain a clean development setup.

## 6. Functional Requirements

- **P0: Must-have**
  - A single command (`make dev`) to bring up the entire stack with all services running and healthy.
  - Externalized configuration to allow customization without modifying core scripts.
  - Secure handling of mock secrets, demonstrating a pattern for real secret management.
  - Inter-service communication enabled, ensuring the API can access the DB and cache.
  - Health checks to confirm all services are operational.
  - A single command to tear down the environment cleanly.
  - Comprehensive documentation for onboarding new developers.

- **P1: Should-have**
  - Automatic service dependency ordering (e.g., database starts before the API).
  - Meaningful output and logging during the startup process.
  - Developer-friendly defaults, such as hot reload and exposed debug ports.
  - Graceful handling of common errors, like port conflicts and missing dependencies.

- **P2: Nice-to-have**
  - Multiple environment profiles (e.g., minimal vs. full stack).
  - Pre-commit hooks or linting setup.
  - Support for local SSL/HTTPS if relevant.
  - Database seeding with test data.
  - Performance optimizations such as parallel startup where feasible.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The environment setup and teardown should be efficient, targeting a setup time of under 10 minutes.
- **Security**: Ensure secure handling of secrets and sensitive configurations.
- **Scalability**: The solution should support future enhancements and additional services.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to standard software development practices and configurations.

## 8. User Experience & Design Considerations

- **Workflows**: Ensure a smooth, linear setup process with clear documentation.
- **Interface Principles**: Provide command-line feedback and logs that are easy to understand.
- **Accessibility Needs**: Ensure scripts and documentation are accessible to developers with varying levels of expertise.

## 9. Technical Requirements

- **System Architecture**: Utilize Kubernetes (k8s) for orchestration, deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
- **Integrations**: Ensure seamless integration with GitHub for version control.
- **APIs**: Use publicly available APIs for any required external services.
- **Data Requirements**: Mock data should be used for initial setup and testing.

## 10. Dependencies & Assumptions

- **Dependencies**: Relies on Kubernetes and GKE for deployment, Docker for containerization.
- **Assumptions**: Developers have basic knowledge of command-line operations and access to necessary tooling (e.g., Docker, Git).

## 11. Out of Scope

- Advanced CI/CD pipeline integrations.
- Production-level secret management systems.
- Comprehensive performance benchmarking beyond basic metrics.

This document outlines the vision and requirements for the Zero-to-Running Developer Environment. The aim is to align stakeholders and empower developers to independently implement the solution, enhancing productivity and streamlining the onboarding process.
